# Hardvard CS50 programming course

Started programming course just to be sure I don't miss out on basic programming techniques I might never come across yet, or am not conscious about yet. This course is a 12 hour course on YouTube, 12 hours to learn the most basic programming principles, so there has to be something to reflect on my basic understanding and knowledge once since I begun. This repository will not contain EVERYTHING from the course, only some examples I think are useful, smart or interesting, or use as cheatsheet. This course is in Python, but that is not a problem because functions, variables, loops, exceptions, libraries, (unit) tests, File I/O, regular expressions and object oriented programming are widespread between all programming languages. Feel free to take a look into these examples, Every file in here is safe to run, you need python installed on your pc and execute "python file-to-run.py"/ 

This course is open and free to follow yourself on YouTube:
